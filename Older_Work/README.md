The drive code is in run.py with helper code in CythonMods.
At the moment there are 2 main helper files which are used, Graph.pyx which updates the graph each timestep, nk_test.pyx which builds the nk_landscape but is likely to soon be changed.

Everything else is related to building the project, testing code, or building the project
